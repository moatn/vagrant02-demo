To set up our web02 server, the following actions need to be done. 

The main purpose of the web02 server is for deploying Docker containers.

1. Add your own public key to the machine. Generate your private/public keys on your host machine (Windows for example) and add the public key to the /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys file. By doing so we can control the server with the 'ssh vagrant@192.168.99.51' command instead of the 'vagrant ssh web02' commaned.
2. Install Docker-ce, docker-compose, vim and fail2ban packages to prepare the server for deploying Docker containers.
3.1 This webserver is for testing purposes only. Try and set up a simpe WordPress Docker container. To do so, you will need to deploy a WordPress Docker container and a MySQL Docker container and create a 'link' between them. You can use the follow references for help:
    https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/

3.2 (EXTRA) You can also try and set-up a WordPress site using Docker-compose. To do so, you can use the following references:
    https://docs.docker.com/compose/wordpress/

When all steps are done, this docker testing server is ready for deployment. 

4. When all previous steps are completed, write a configuration manual for web02 server.
